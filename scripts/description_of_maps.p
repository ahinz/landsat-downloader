aVVegetation Indices 16-Day L3 Global 250m

aVGlobal MODIS vegetation indices are designed to provide consistent spatial and temporal comparisons of vegetation conditions. Blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 469-nanometers, 645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine the MODIS daily vegetation indices.\u000aThe MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also includes a new Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows.\u000aGlobal MYD13Q1 data are provided every 16 days at 250-meter spatial resolution as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection. Lacking a 250m blue band, the EVI algorithm uses the 500m blue band to correct for residual atmospheric effects, with negligible spatial artifacts.\u000aVegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and hydrologic processes and global and regional climate. These data also may be used for characterizing land surface biophysical properties and processes, including primary production and land cover conversion.\u000aVersion-5 MODIS/Aqua Vegetation Indices products are Validated Stage 2, meaning that accuracy has been assessed over a widely distributed set of locations and time periods via several ground-truth and validation efforts.

aVThe new MODIS 250 m land-water mask (Short Name: MOD44W) is an improvement over the existing MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and MODIS land cover-based global land-water mask (Salomon et al., 2004). The MODIS NBAR and land cover\u2013based mask was itself an improved version of the EOS DEM-based land-water mask (Logan et al., 1999). The new MODIS 250 m mask is primarily created with three different data inputs:\u000a\u000a		The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission\u2019s (SRTM) Water Body Dataset (SWBD) (Areas between 60° S to 60° N);\u000a\u000a		The MOD44C, a non-public, 250 m global 16-day composite collection based on 8+ years of Terra MODIS data, and 6+ years of Aqua MODIS data. This data set originally provided the input to produce the Vegetative Cover Conversion, and Vegetative Continuous Fields products (Areas between 60° N to 90° N); and\u000a\u000a		The MODIS\u2013based Mosaic of Antarctica (MOA), which is a 250 m MODIS level-1b mosaic for Antarctica (Areas within Antarctica between 60° S and 90° S).\u000aOther appropriate and publicly available data sets were also used to supplement the production of the MODIS 250 m land\u2013water mask. Additional details regarding the methodology are available in the User Guide.\u000aThis marks the first time that such a global MODIS-SRTM land-water mask is offered publicly to end-users. This data set is provided in the same gridded tile structure that is common to several higher-level MODIS land products.

aVVegetation Continuous Fields Yearly L3 Global 250m
p50
aVThe Terra MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) product is a sub-pixel-level representation of surface vegetation cover estimates globally.  Designed to continuously represent Earth\u2019s terrestrial surface as a proportion of basic vegetation traits, it provides a gradation of three surface cover components: percent tree cover, percent non-tree cover, and percent bare.  VCF products provide a continuous, quantitative portrayal of land surface cover with improved spatial detail, and hence, are widely used in environmental modeling and monitoring applications.\u000aThe first generation of the VCF algorithm involved a semi-automated process to generate regression trees with machine learning software.  A human operator was required to evaluate the tree and decide if it needed more or less training data inputs.  The V003 VCF product is the first version from that generation, and only contains the percent tree cover layer, as does the current V005.  A subsequent version will incorporate the additional two layers (i.e., percent non-tree vegetation and percent bare).  Generated yearly, the VCF product is produced using monthly composites of Terra MODIS 250 and 500 meters Land Surface Reflectance data, including all seven bands, and Land Surface Temperature.\u000aSeveral reasons help explain the inter-annual fluctuations in the percentage of tree cover from year to year, and therefore, users should exercise caution when considering performing inter-annual comparisons of VCF.\u000aThe VCF products are validated to stage-1; this means that their product accuracy was estimated through an assessment of the training data\u2019s accuracy, and from limited in situ field validation datasets.

aVMCD45A1 is a monthly Level-3 gridded 500-meter product, which contains burning and quality information on a per-pixel basis. Produced from both the Terra and Aqua MODIS-derived daily surface reflectance inputs, the algorithm analyzes the daily surface reflectance dynamics to locate rapid changes, uses that information to detect the approximate date of burning, and maps the spatial extent of recent fires only. It provides varied quality assessment information and a single summary quality assessment score for each pixel.\u000aThe MCD45A1 algorithm improves on previous methods by using a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model-based change detection approach to handle angular variations in the data. It further uses a statistical measure to identify change probability from a previously observed state. A monthly MCD45A1 product is based on three months of atmospherically and geometrically corrected, cloud-screened daily reflectance data.

aVAttention: The Dynamics_QC layer of the MCD12Q2 products is not performing as intended. Users are advised to ignore QC information until the issue is resolved.\u000aThe V005 MODIS Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product (informally called the MODIS Global Vegetation Phenology product) provides estimates of the timing of vegetation phenology at global scales. Additionally, it also provides information related to the range and summation of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) computed from MODIS surface reflectance data at each pixel. It identifies the vegetation growth, maturity, and senescence that mark seasonal cycles. In contrast to the version 004 incarnation of this product (MOD12Q2), MCD12Q2 uses both Terra and Aqua MODIS input data. MCD12Q2 is produced once a year with 24 months of input data (i.e., the 12 months of interest data bracketed by six month\u2019s data on either side). The version 005 MCD12Q2 products range from 2001 through 2006.\u000aMCD12Q2 primarily uses MODIS EVI, which is computed from the MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) product instead of the MOD09 surface reflectance product. In contrast to the version 004 product, MCD12Q2 uses NBAR values computed from an 8-day period at 500 m spatial resolution. Huete et al. (2002) provide the formula used to derive the EVI from the NBAR data. The snow and ice flag included in the MODIS NBAR product\u2019s QA field is useful to filter out data points associated with snow-covered surfaces from the input time-series, especially because snow presence introduces large temporal variations in EVI that are not associated with vegetation phenology.

aVLeaf Area Index \u2013 Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation 4-Day L4 Global 1km
p215
aVLeaf Area Index (LAI) is a dimensionless variable defined as the total one-sided area of green leaves in a vegetation canopy relative to a unit ground area. LAI ignores canopy details such as leaf angle distribution, canopy height or shape. LAI values typically range from 0 for bare ground to 6 or above for a dense forest. Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR) is also a dimensionless variable defined as the fraction of the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation. FPAR is directly related to the primary productivity function of photosynthesis, and therefore, used to estimate the assimilation of CO2 in vegetation. Both variables are used to calculate surface photosynthesis, evapotranspiration, and net primary production, which help model the terrestrial energy, carbon, and biogeochemical components of vegetation.\u000aIn contrast to the Terra-MODIS (MOD15A2), Aqua-MODIS (MYD15A2), and the combined Terra and Aqua MODIS (MCD15A2) versions of the 8-day LAI and FPAR products, the level-4 combined (Terra and Aqua) MODIS global LAI and FPAR product is composited every 4 days at 1-kilometer resolution. Projected on a Sinusoidal grid, the MCD15A3 product includes the following Science Data Sets (SDS): LAI, FPAR, and a set of quality rating, and standard deviation layers for each variable. The increased temporal frequency of the 4-day product helps in monitoring phenology and associated rapid changes (that occur within less than a week) especially during transition periods (green-up and senescence).
